  Analog Devices TMC52XX Stepper Motor Controller (UART single-wire mode)

  This binding supports the single-wire UART mode where:
  - SWIOP is connected to the MCU's UART TX/RX pin
  - SWION should be connected to half the IO level voltage (1.65V for 3.3V systems)
  - SW_SEL must be HIGH (either via GPIO control or hardwired)

  Example:

    &uart2 {
        current-speed = <115200>;
        status = "okay";

        tmc52xx: tmc52xx {
            compatible = "adi,tmc52xx";
            sw-sel-gpios = <&gpiob 0x01 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;

            /* Common settings from base binding */
            clock-frequency = <DT_FREQ_M(12)>;
            en-pwm-mode;
            invert-direction;
            micro-step-res = <256>;

            /* ADI TMC ramp generator as well as current settings */
            vstart = <0>;
            vstop = <10>;
            a1 = <1000>;
            v1 = <50000>;
            d1 = <1400>;
            vmax = <200000>;
            amax = <50000>;
            dmax = <700>;
            tzerowait = <100>;
            ihold = <10>;
            irun = <31>;
            iholddelay = <6>;
        };
    };

      Must be set HIGH for UART mode operation.
      If not provided, it's assumed SW_SEL is hardwired to VCC/HIGH.
